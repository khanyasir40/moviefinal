üöÄ **AUTOMATED REPOSITORY CREATION FOR khanyasir40**

I'll create the GitHub repository automatically using your browser automation.

**Method 1: Browser Automation (Recommended)**
I can open the GitHub new repository page with all fields pre-filled for you.

**Method 2: Manual Quick Setup (2 minutes)**
If automation fails, I'll guide you through super quick manual steps.

**Method 3: Alternative Deployment**
I can deploy directly to Railway/Vercel without GitHub (using ZIP file).
